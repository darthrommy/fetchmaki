# fetchmaki

The name `fetchmaki` is a mixture of Javascript built-in method `fetch` and Japanese word `maki` - _wrapping something_. You may know some kind of _sushiüç£_, like _Tekka maki_ and _Kappa maki_.

Since this library's main purpose is to wrap `res.json()` with Typescript, I thought the nuance of _maki_ was a perfect fit.

I'm launching the [documentation site](https://rommy-docs.page.dev/docs/fetchmaki) for this library. Come and see for the details.
